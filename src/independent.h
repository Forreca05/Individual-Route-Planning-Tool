 *
 * This header defines the functions related to the "independent" algorithm, which computes
 * the best and alternative routes between two nodes in a graph, ensuring that the two
 * routes do not share any intermediate nodes or segments, except for the source and destination.
 * It also handles both interactive (terminal) and batch processing modes.

/**
 * @brief Runs the shortest path algorithm to compute the best and alternative routes.
 *
 * This function executes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the best or alternative route
 * between the given source and destination. If it's the first run, intermediate nodes
 * are added to the set of avoided nodes for the alternative route.
 *
 * @param graph The graph where the algorithm will search for routes.
 * @param source The starting node for the route.
 * @param destination The target node for the route.
 * @param avoidNodes A set of nodes to avoid during the second run (used in the alternative route).
 * @param avoidEdges A set of edges to avoid (not used in the current implementation).
 * @param mode The mode of transportation (e.g., "driving", "walking").
 * @param parked Indicates if there is parking available at the source or destination.
 * @param out The output stream where results are printed.
 * @param isFirstRun Flag indicating if it is the first execution (for determining best or alternative route).
 *
 * @note Complexity is O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
 * Dijkstra's algorithm runs twice.
