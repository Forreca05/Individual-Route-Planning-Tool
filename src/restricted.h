 * This header defines the functions related to the "restricted" algorithm, which computes
 * the best route considering specific restrictions. These restrictions may include:
 * - Avoiding specific nodes.
 * - Avoiding specific segments of the graph (edges).
 * - Simultaneously avoiding nodes and edges.
 * - Including specific nodes that the route must visit.

/**
 * @brief Runs the restricted pathfinding algorithm, considering avoidance and inclusion constraints.
 *
 * This function computes the shortest path between two nodes in the graph, taking into account
 * the avoidance of specific nodes and segments, and including a specific node if required. If
 * an inclusion node is specified, the algorithm first finds the shortest path to this node and then
 * proceeds from that node to the destination.
 *
 * @param graph The graph where the algorithm will search for the best route.
 * @param source The starting node of the route.
 * @param destination The target node of the route.
 * @param includeNode A node that must be included in the path (-1 if not applicable).
 * @param avoidNodes A set of nodes to avoid during pathfinding.
 * @param avoidEdges A set of edges to avoid during pathfinding.
 * @param mode The mode of transportation (e.g., "driving", "walking").
 * @param parked A boolean indicating if parking is available at source or destination.
 * @param out The output stream to write the result (either std::cout or a file).
 *
 * @note Complexity is O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
